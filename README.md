# Files Comparison Tool

With a friend a few days ago we were trying to install mods on a game we both have, but we had different files and it was so dificult to know wich file i was missing or viceversa. So for that i created 2 scripts that reads and print into a text file all the files names stored on a specific folder, then using the second script it compares the two text files that were created and prints and output that shows wich files are missing or files that are left over.

For use:

-change what path you want to do in the code (it says literally in the code) in names-to-list.py
-put your first and second text list path onto the part that says in the code to change in lists-comparison.py
